The pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are the fundamental concepts that underpin this programming methodology. These pillars are as follows:

1. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary. This is achieved through the definition of classes with attributes (properties) and methods (behaviors) that operate on those attributes. Encapsulation protects an object's data and prevents direct access from outside the class, helping to ensure data integrity and facilitating code maintenance.

2. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism that allows the creation of a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its attributes and methods. The inheriting class is known as a subclass or derived class, and the original class is called a superclass or base class. Inheritance facilitates code reuse and the creation of class hierarchies that represent relationships between real-world objects.

3. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects from different classes to behave similarly through a common interface. This is achieved by implementing methods with the same name in different classes but with specific behaviors for each class. Polymorphism enables writing more generic and flexible code, as it's not necessary to know the specific type of object to interact with it.

4. **Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of simplifying an object by focusing on its most important characteristics and omitting unnecessary details. Classes in OOP are examples of abstraction, as they represent simplified models of real-world objects. Abstraction helps programmers understand and model complex systems by focusing on essential aspects.

These pillars form the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming and are essential for designing and implementing modular, maintainable, and reusable software systems. The appropriate combination of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction enables the creation of programs that effectively and efficiently model and solve real-world problems.
